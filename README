Hoth was created by Aaron Greenlee

FarCry plugin created by Sean Coyne (http://www.n42designs.com)

REQUIREMENTS:

ColdFusion 9 or Railo 3.2 (Hoth uses cfscript CFCs and other CF9 functionality, not sure about the Railo requirement, but this has been tested on Railo 3.2 and ColdFusion 9.0.1)
FarCry 5.2 or higher (This has been tested on FarCry 6.0.9, however no FC 6-specific functionality was used so it should run on 5.2 just fine.)

UPDATES:

04/06/2011: Updated Hoth to latest version from GitHub.  Allows configuration of the logFileIsRelative setting.  If set to false, you can specify a path a full path to the log file directory.  Be sure to update your FarCry config!

03/11/2011: Updated Hoth to latest version from GitHub.  Plugin now uses Hoth's built in reporting UI rather than a custom version.  This should allow for less maintenance as Hoth is updated going forward.

02/17/2011: Initial version.  This was created using the initial release of Hoth.  Aaron plans to make some updates to the reporting features which may break the functionality here so use caution if you manually upgrade the copy of Hoth included with the plugin.

INSTALLATION:

To install, add "farcryhoth" to the list of plugins in your farcry constructor and copy the "farcryhoth" folder to your /farcry/plugins directory

Create a webserver mapping so that /farcryhoth maps to the www folder in the plugin
	ex: Alias /farcryhoth "/Users/username/Sites/farcry/plugins/farcryhoth/www"

Copy the following code to your farcryConstructor.cfm anywhere after <cfset this.mappings = structnew() /> (note the capital "H" in Hoth for case-sensitive file systems):
	<cfset this.mappings["/Hoth"] = expandPath("/farcry/plugins/farcryhoth/packages/custom/hoth") />

Copy the following code to your onError method of your Application.cfc just before the cfreturn (you may need to change the name of your exception argument):	
	<cfif structKeyExists(application,"hoth")>
		<cfset application.hoth.hoth.track(arguments.exception) />
	</cfif>

Perform an updateapp on your FarCry site, then log into the webtop and go to Admin --> Edit Config and edit the "Hoth: ColdFusion Exception Tracking" configuration.

Perform another updateapp and you will be done.
